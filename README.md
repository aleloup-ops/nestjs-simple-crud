# nestjs-simple-crud

## Project Description ##

The goal of this project is to create a simple CRUD at first using NestJs. The API is made with GraphQL and firestore is used as the database. I decided to work on this project as a point of start discovering NestJs.

I also want to grow the project more and more as I'm learning new NestJs features.

## How to install and Run the project ##

#### What you will need to run the project : ####

- Node.Js
- @nestjs/cli

This project uses firestore as database, you will need first to create a project on console.firebase.com. Then you will have to create a new collection called "books" on firestore.

Last step is to add your credentials to the project. To do so go to "Projects Settings" > Service Accounts > Generate a new key. You can now download a json file that you will rename "serviceAccountkey.json" that you will move in the nest-app folder.

#### Install and Run the project ####

First, clone the repository running this command :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleloup-ops/nestjs-simple-crud.git
```
Now access the nest-app directory :

```bash
cd nest-app/
```

To install all the required packages, run :

```bash
npm install
```

Now build the project either with nest cli or npm :

```bash
nest build
```

or

```bash
npm run build
```

You are now ready to run the project :

```bash
nest start
```

or 

```bash
npm run start
```

## How to use the project ##

Since this project only contains an API, you can either call it by yourself on port 3000 with the "/graphql" endpoint. I also implemented graphql playground, so you can just access "localhost:3000/graphql" on any browser and try querying from there.

## Documentation ##

The project is using package spectaql to document the GraphQL API.

To generate the documentation, run :

```bash
npx spectaql config.yml
```

The documentation is now available in the `public` directory at the root of the project as index.html. Open it with your internet browser to get more data about the API
